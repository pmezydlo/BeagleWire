This example uses the [Digilent PMOD seven segment display](https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-ssd-seven-segment-display/)
As mentioned in issue #12 in the BeagleWire repo, PMOD accessories must be attached 'upside down'.

If the seven segment display is plugged into the pins nearest the top of the BeagleBoneBlack (where you see the LEDs light up), it should [look like this](https://imgur.com/a/qdOp2fl).
